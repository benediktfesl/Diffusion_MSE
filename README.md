## Load data
Load data and pre-trained models from 
https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiAsDStAV6i5FFJHyfhrcY/ (Passcode: Diffusion2024)
and move it to the project's directory.

## Information about required packages
Down below is a list of mandatory and optional packages with their versions, if a specific version is required.
### Mandatory packages
* conda-build
* cudatoolkit=11.8
* numpy
* pytorch=2.0.1
* torchvision=0.15.2=py310_cu118 (only if working with image data)
* pytorch-cuda=11.8
* scikit-learn
* scipy
* tqdm
* pip
* pytorch-fid==0.3
* matplotlib

### Optional packages (for jupyter notebooks or special script options)
* seaborn
* ipykernel
* ray-core
* ray-tune
* ray-train
* ray-dashboard

## Common Usage 
1. Train and test a DPM-based denoiser on GPU
```shell
python dpm_denoiser.py -d cuda:0
```

2. Load pre-trained model and evaluate it
```shell
python load_and_eval_dpm.py -d cuda:0
```

3. Evaluate real-valued baselines (GMM-based CME and LS)
```shell
python baselines.py
```

4. Evaluate complex-valued baseline with audio-data (GMM-based CME and LS)
```shell
python audio_gmm.py
```

## Data Options
1. rand_gmm
2. MNIST_gmm
3. FASHION_MNIST_gmm
4. audio_gmm
